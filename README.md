# Post-stroke-Analysis-Using-Interactive-Rehabilitation

## Abstract

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability. The majority of survivors have mobility abnormalities, and many have persistent dexterity impairments. Patients can restore many of their lost functions with post-stroke rehabilitation therapy. Game-based methodologies have been proposed to keep patients motivated and achieve therapeutic goals during stroke rehabilitation therapy. We've created a movable actuated glove orthosis with a flex sensor that detects the fingers' flexing ability. By use of this interactive rehabilitation using a game which improves the upper extremity control and task performance. Unity 3D has been updated to include a hand-training game. 
The goal of this study is to see if activities that fostered more mobility, were more entertaining, and were less active may help patients with hand disabilities. It is a portable and cost-effective haptic controller system for use in games. 

## Technologies used:
